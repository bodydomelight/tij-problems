  1 : The Focke-Wulf Fw 190 Wurger (English: Shrike) was a German single-seat,
  2 :  single-engine fighter aircraft designed by Kurt Tank in the late 1930s
  3 :  and widely used during World War II. Powered by a radial engine, the 190
  4 :  had ample power and was able to lift larger loads than its well-known
  5 :  counterpart, the Messerschmitt Bf 109. The 190 was used by the Luftwaffe
  6 :  in a wide variety of roles, including day fighter, fighter-bomber,
  7 :  ground-attack aircraft and, to a lesser degree, night fighter.
  8 : 
  9 : When the Fw 190 started flying operationally over France in August 1941,
 10 :  it quickly proved itself to be superior in all but turn radius to the Royal
 11 :  Air Force's main front-line fighter, the Spitfire Mk. V.[2] The 190 wrested
 12 :  air superiority away from the RAF until the introduction of the vastly
 13 :  improved Spitfire Mk. IX in July 1942 restored qualitative parity.[3] The
 14 :  Fw 190 made its air combat debut on the Eastern Front in November/December
 15 :  1942; though Soviet pilots considered the Bf 109 the greater threat, the
 16 :  Fw 190 made a significant impact. The fighter and its pilots proved just as
 17 :  capable as the Bf 109 in aerial combat, and in the opinion of German pilots
 18 :  who flew both, provided increased firepower and manoeuvrability at low to
 19 :  medium altitude.
 20 : 
 21 : The Fw 190 became the backbone of the Jagdwaffe (Fighter Force), along with
 22 :  the Bf 109. On the Eastern Front, the Fw 190 was versatile enough to use in
 23 :  Schlachtgeschwader (Battle Wings or Strike Wings), specialised ground attack
 24 :  units which achieved much success against Soviet ground forces. As an
 25 :  interceptor, the Fw 190 underwent improvements to make it effective at high
 26 :  altitude, enabling it to maintain relative parity with its Allied opponents.
 27 :  The Fw 190A series' performance decreased at high altitudes (usually 6,000 m
 28 :  (20,000 ft) and above), which reduced its effectiveness as a high-altitude
 29 :  interceptor, but this problem was mostly rectified in later models,
 30 :  particularly in the Junkers Jumo 213 inline-engine Focke-Wulf Fw 190D series,
 31 :  which was introduced in September 1944. In spite of its successes, it never
 32 :  entirely replaced the Bf 109.
 33 : 
 34 : The Fw 190 was well liked by its pilots. Some of the Luftwaffe's most
 35 :  successful fighter aces claimed a great many of their kills while flying it,
 36 :  including Otto Kittel, Walter Nowotny and Erich Rudorffer.
