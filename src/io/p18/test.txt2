The Focke-Wulf Fw 190 Wurger (English: Shrike) was a German single-seat,
single-engine fighter aircraft designed by Kurt Tank in the late 1930s
and widely used during World War II. Powered by a radial engine, the 190
had ample power and was able to lift larger loads than its well-known
counterpart, the Messerschmitt Bf 109. The 190 was used by the Luftwaffe
in a wide variety of roles, including day fighter, fighter-bomber,
ground-attack aircraft and, to a lesser degree, night fighter.

When the Fw 190 started flying operationally over France in August 1941,
it quickly proved itself to be superior in all but turn radius to the Royal
Air Force's main front-line fighter, the Spitfire Mk. V.[2] The 190 wrested
air superiority away from the RAF until the introduction of the vastly
improved Spitfire Mk. IX in July 1942 restored qualitative parity.[3] The
Fw 190 made its air combat debut on the Eastern Front in November/December
1942; though Soviet pilots considered the Bf 109 the greater threat, the
Fw 190 made a significant impact. The fighter and its pilots proved just as
capable as the Bf 109 in aerial combat, and in the opinion of German pilots
who flew both, provided increased firepower and manoeuvrability at low to
medium altitude.

The Fw 190 became the backbone of the Jagdwaffe (Fighter Force), along with
the Bf 109. On the Eastern Front, the Fw 190 was versatile enough to use in
Schlachtgeschwader (Battle Wings or Strike Wings), specialised ground attack
units which achieved much success against Soviet ground forces. As an
interceptor, the Fw 190 underwent improvements to make it effective at high
altitude, enabling it to maintain relative parity with its Allied opponents.
The Fw 190A series' performance decreased at high altitudes (usually 6,000 m
(20,000 ft) and above), which reduced its effectiveness as a high-altitude
interceptor, but this problem was mostly rectified in later models,
particularly in the Junkers Jumo 213 inline-engine Focke-Wulf Fw 190D series,
which was introduced in September 1944. In spite of its successes, it never
entirely replaced the Bf 109.

The Fw 190 was well liked by its pilots. Some of the Luftwaffe's most
successful fighter aces claimed a great many of their kills while flying it,
including Otto Kittel, Walter Nowotny and Erich Rudorffer.
